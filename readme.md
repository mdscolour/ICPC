This is the program that can extract the intra-chromosomal potentials from nucleosomal positioning data.
The obtained are effective potential for single nucleosomes, which represent the organization mechanism for that specific section and can serve as a status identifier for further study.

The steps are:
Preparing iNPS data (iNPS program not included)
Obtaining RDF data
Running simulations to obtain the parameters
Computing configurations and compressibilities
